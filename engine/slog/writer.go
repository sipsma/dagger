// Writer queues log output for a shared destination (usually stderr) and
// writes it from one background goroutine, so goroutines that log at the
// same time do not each wait for every other goroutine's write(2).
//
// Bytes reach the destination in the order Write calls queued them. Each
// Write is queued whole, so a log line is never split or interleaved with
// another line written through the Writer. Queued bytes, including the batch
// being written, are bounded by limit (a single larger line is let through
// alone): Write blocks while the queue is full, so a destination that cannot
// keep up slows callers down instead of losing output.
//
// Write returns once its bytes are queued, except for lines whose level is
// WARN or worse when SyncWarn is set; those wait until they are written, as
// with a plain locked writer. WriteSync and Flush wait too. A destination
// write error loses the rest of that batch, as a failed direct write loses
// its line; callers waiting on those bytes get the error and the count of
// their bytes that were written.
//
// A Writer runs one goroutine for the life of the process and has no Close:
// it is meant for the process's own log output.
