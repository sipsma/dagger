// changeMarks are the holdings and entries a blob-backed cache's writes have
// changed since the last write handed them back (takeChangesLocked), for its
// reader to ask again of only those (RemoteChange.Holdings and Entries).
//
// An entry is marked where anything a reader asks of it changes. What an
// entry's class mates answer changes too when the entry's value, record,
// stored parts or expiry change, or its class gains it: their part answers
// consider it (AvailablePart), and their classes' entries include it. Those
// marks (markEntryClassLocked) are widened to every entry of the entry's
// classes when the marks are handed back. Its holdings and recipes are its
// own (markEntryLocked). Its holdings would reach its class mates only by
// turning whether it has a value (noValueLocked), which never happens to an
// entry that stays: an entry with no value is owned by its holdings alone,
// as a prune drops only values that holdings alone keep and a value depends
// only on entries with values, so it goes with its last engine holding
// (markLeavingLocked); and one gains its first holding only as it is
// created, which marks its class. Classes only grow
// until an entry is removed, so widening then reaches every entry whose
// class the change touched, but for a removed entry's: its class mates are
// marked as it leaves its classes (markLeavingLocked), while the classes
// still name them.
//
// A holding is marked where any field of its description
// (RemoteHoldingInfo) changes, and where it is created or removed.
//
// Marks are appended, an entry or holding as often as it changes, and sorted
// and deduplicated once, when handed back: a write's marks cost an append
// each. Only a blob-backed cache marks: an engine's own cache has no reader
// to tell, and its changes is nil. Guarded by egraphMu.
//
// Each mark has a reason (markReason): selection's, for the reader a write
// hands its marks back to, or the save's, for the writer behind
// (WriteBehind), which takes them across writes. The save's marks name the
// entries whose saved rows may differ (saveEntries) and the classes whose
// identity rows may differ (saveClasses); last uses, which change under the
// read lock, wait apart (usedMarks).
